## About Inxi ##

Inxi is developed to work on most GNU/Linux distributions. The script comes pre-installed in [SolusOS](http://solusos.com/), [Crunchbang](http://crunchbanglinux.org/), [Epidemic](http://www.epidemiclinux.org/), [Linux Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/) and [AntiX](http://antix.mepis.org). [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/inxi/) has the inxi package in their **Community Repos**.  We hope, as more maintainers and users discover and find inxi a nice tool, it will find its place in more distributions.

Inxi works on [Konversation](http://konversation.kde.org/), [Xchat](http://xchat.org/), [irssi](http://irssi.org/), [Quassel](http://quassel-irc.org/), as well as on most other IRC clients.  Quassel includes (usually an older version of) inxi.

See [inxi options](http://code.google.com/p/inxi/wiki/inxi) here for list of options.  Always check inxi -h to get the full list of the latest options (the wiki page may become outdated).

## Script Feedback and Bug Reports ##

For us to help you the best, please make sure to include all relevant system data and output when you post bug reports. inxi includes built in data collection tools you can run that create either log files or more full system data. See inxi -h, the -@ series of options for more information. Usually the more of your system data we can get, the more easily we can fix the failed case, which is our goal.

If you would like to give some feedback, use the [script developer forum](http://techpatterns.com/forums/about1131.html) or the [script main forum](http://techpatterns.com/forums/about1133.html).

Post any related issues or developer type questions in the [script developer forums](http://techpatterns.com/forums/forum-32.html).

Or, use the [Issues tab](http://code.google.com/p/inxi/issues/list) to post bug reports or feature request.

## The Origins of inxi ##

Inxi is a full rewrite, by h2 and trash80, of the locsmif's infobash script.

The original infobash scripting methods were not debuggable, readable, or maintainable, so we forked the script.

We started with a set of bug fixes and code readability updates. Then, once the potential became exposed, we added more features.  The rewrites far exceeded the original utility, thus the inxi project began.
